            <h2>My Story</h2>
            <p>
              Hi, I’m Rachel Sadeh, a UX and Product Designer based in
              Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. My passion lies in creating accessible,
              user-centered designs that make technology more inclusive for
              everyone. Growing up in the “Steel City” has shaped my
              appreciation for both its cultural history and innovative future,
              fueling my commitment to design solutions that break down
              barriers.
            </p>
            <p>
              I hold a Master’s in Human-Computer Interaction from Carnegie
              Mellon University and a B.S. in Psychology from the University of
              Pittsburgh, where I also picked up a second major in Digital
              Narrative and Interactive Design (Online Media track) with a
              certificate in Children's Literature and Studies.
            </p>
            <p>
              This education allowed me to hone my skills in empathizing with
              audiences and users, combining my writing and design abilities to
              create user-centered designs with a focus on accessibility.
            </p>
            <p>
              My undergraduate studies at the University of Pittsburgh included
              a double major in Psychology and Digital Narrative & Interactive
              Design, along with a certificate in Children’s Literature. This
              diverse educational background gives me a unique perspective on
              how to design for a wide range of users.
            </p>
            <p>
              I now apply this knowledge as a freelance digital designer and
              consultant, specializing in accessible designs across various
              platforms and working closely with crossfunctional teams.
            </p>
